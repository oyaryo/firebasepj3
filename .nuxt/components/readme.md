# Discovered Components

This is an auto-generated list of components discovered by [nuxt/components](https://github.com/nuxt/components).

You can directly use them in pages and other components without the need to import them.

**Tip:** If a component is conditionally rendered with `v-if` and is big, it is better to use `Lazy` or `lazy-` prefix to lazy load.

- `<FooterView>` | `<footer-view>` (components/FooterView.vue)
- `<HeaderView>` | `<header-view>` (components/HeaderView.vue)
- `<CommonConstants>` | `<common-constants>` (components/common/constants.js)
